# Despite the unfortunate naming convention of this file, KiCad does not have code "owners".
# All parts of KiCad are worked on by all developers, and we do not require explicit approval
# from any particular person in order to accept contributions or fixes to sections of KiCad.

# This file is used to generate suggested reviewers for pull requests that touch certain parts
# of the KiCad codebase based on the development history of those parts.  Most of KiCad does not
# have a particular set of reviewers defined in this file, and in general, it is a good thing if
# entries can be removed from this file over time, because it indicates that expertise about
# parts of the codebase that once were only familiar to one or two developers is now shared among
# a wider set of the core development team.

# Contributors: despite this file, the KiCad team still primarily matches up new merge requests
# with reviewers based on developer availability.  If a change you propose touches files that
# are covered by entries in this file, the relevant developer(s) may or may not be the final
# reviewer(s) for your merge request.

# Core team developers: consider adding yourself to places where you are commonly asked for
# review feedback by the rest of the team.  Consider removing yourself if you are stepping back
# from participating in KiCad code review, or if you notice that an area you were previously
# listed as a reviewer because not many others were familiar with it is now familiar with the
# larger team.
